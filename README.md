# # Restaurant Order Application
We developed this project in Java as part of the Object Oriented Programming course.
 - Thanks to this restaurant application we have created, managers will be able to control their profit-loss ratios and their employees.
 - They will be informed about the economic situation thanks to the total income-expense table and worker salaries tab.
 - Waiters, on the other hand, will ensure the continuity of the operation by processing the customers' orders into this application.
